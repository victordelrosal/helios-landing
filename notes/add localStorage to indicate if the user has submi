add localStorage to indicate if the user has submitted a valid email. This should be an On/Off indicator submittedEmail = "YES' or submittedEmail = "NO'. By default: submittedEmail = "NO'. Leave all else intact

if submittedEmail = 'YES' then display this: 'Choose Your Package' section with pricing options and ðŸ’¸ 100% Money Back Unbeatable Guarantee. This specific content should ALWAYS be displayed on the page automatically (skip the assessment tool). only display the assessment tool when submittedEmail = 'NO'. Obviously rest of content for the whole page should ALWAYS be displayed regardless of submittedEmail status. Leave all else intact.
